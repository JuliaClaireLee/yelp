We are trying to create a user friendly Yelp look up shiny web app that allows clients to use their [Yelp api key](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) and query up to 200 results based on key words, location, and distance (in miles) to create almost a digital phone book (name of business, phone, address, city, zip code).  This app is currently local only  (not intended for any use beyond educational purposes)!!!!!
